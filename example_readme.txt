CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
-------------------

1. Abstract for the dataset 
Sea surface temperature (SST) was measured by several instruments deployed from the research vessel Sally Ride in the Bay of Bengal for the Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations in the Bay of Bengal (MISO-BOB) 2019 field experiment. This data set presents 1 minute averages of 3 m SST from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Fast Current-Temperature-Depth sounder (FCTD), 0.2 m SST from the Oregon State University SurfOtter, and 0.1 m SST from a sensor attached to a floating sea snake constructed by the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory. Raw 2 s^-1 samples of the sea snake SST are also presented.

2. Context
Separate NetCDF (https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) time series files are provided for each sensor (FCTD, SurfOtter, and sea snake).

These files are submitted to ScholarsArchive@OSU to fulfill FAIR data archiving and sharing requirements at the sumission of the manucript de Szoeke (2021).

3. Date of data collection:
[single date or range or approximate date in format YYYY-MM-DD]
2019

4. Geographic location of data collection:
MISO-BOB 2019 leg 2 survey area (17.1 N,80 E,13 N,90 E)

5. Funding sources that supported the collection of the data:
Support for the MISO-BOB field experiment was provided by the US Office of Naval Research

6. Acknowledgement
We acknowledge Drew Lucas for the Scripps FCTD SST data and Emily Shroyer for the SurfOtter SST data. Support for the MISO-BOB field experiment was provided by the US Office of Naval Research.
